    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="service">
      <h2>5. Description of service</h2>
      <p>nightbio provides a link-in-bio service: you create a profile page (with photo, bio, and links) and receive a short URL (e.g. nightbio.lol/yourusername) that you can share. The Service is provided “as is” and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued in whole or in part. We do not guarantee availability, accuracy, or compatibility with all devices or third-party services. Features and limits may change over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="acceptable-use">
      <h2>6. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree to use the Service only in compliance with these Terms and applicable law. You must not use the Service to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Post, host, or link to content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, obscene, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable</li>

      <p>We may remove User Content and suspend or terminate accounts that we reasonably believe violate these rules or harm the Service or others. We are not obligated to monitor content but may do so. Repeated violations may result in permanent termination.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="content">
      <h2>7. User content and license</h2>
      <p>You retain ownership of User Content you submit. By submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to host, store, display, reproduce, and distribute that content solely in connection with operating and providing the Service. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant this license and that your User Content does not violate any third-party rights or these Terms. We may remove User Content without notice where we believe it violates these Terms or the law.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="privacy">
      <h2>8. Privacy and data</h2>
      <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our privacy practices. We collect and process information as described in our privacy policy (if published) or as necessary to provide, secure, and improve the Service. By using the Service, you consent to such collection and use. We may use cookies and similar technologies. Data may be processed in jurisdictions where we or our service providers operate. If you have questions about privacy, contact us or review our privacy policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="ip">
      <h2>9. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>We and our licensors own the Service (including design, code, and branding) and any content we provide that is not User Content. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of the Service or our branding without our prior written permission. “nightbio” and related marks are our trademarks; you may not use them in a way that suggests endorsement or affiliation except as permitted by the Service (e.g. displaying your bio link).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="disclaimers">
      <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR USER CONTENT, THIRD-PARTY SITES OR SERVICES YOU LINK TO, OR THE CONDUCT OF USERS OR THIRD PARTIES. YOU USE THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="liability">
      <h2>11. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL) ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM, OR (B) ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS ($100). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS; IN SUCH CASES OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="indemnity">
      <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from (a) your use of the Service, (b) your User Content, (c) your violation of these Terms or any law, or (d) your violation of any third-party rights. We reserve the right to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you; you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="termination">
      <h2>13. Termination</h2>
      <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access or account at any time, with or without cause or notice, including for violation of these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases. Sections that by their nature should survive (including disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, and governing law) will survive termination.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="disputes">
      <h2>14. Dispute resolution and governing law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there. You waive any right to a jury trial and any right to participate in a class action. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="changes">
      <h2>15. Changes to the terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms on this page and update the “Last updated” date. For material changes, we may provide additional notice (e.g. via the Service or email). Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="general">
      <h2>16. General provisions</h2>
      <p>These Terms, together with any referenced policies, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede prior agreements. Our failure to enforce any right or provision is not a waiver of that right or provision. You may not assign these Terms without our consent; we may assign them without restriction. Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section" id="contact">
      <h2>17. Contact</h2>
      <p>For questions about these Terms or the Service, contact us via our <a href="https://discord.gg/eXPSwFCEEX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Discord server</a> or through any contact method provided on the nightbio.lol website.</p>
