**🎵 New on nightbio.lol: real uploads**

We’re adding **actual file uploads** so you’re not stuck with links only.

**Background music**  
You can now **upload your own MP3** for your bio’s background music. No need to rely on a Spotify (or other) link — drop your track and it’s yours.

**Profile picture**  
You can **upload your PFP** directly instead of pasting an image URL. Same for your banner/cover — upload the file and we host it.

Everything still works with URLs if you prefer; uploads are an extra option. Try it out in your dashboard and share your links.

**Short version (if you need a smaller post):**

🎵 **Update:** You can now **upload MP3s** for background music and **upload your PFP** (and banner) instead of using links. Check your dashboard — same place, new upload buttons.
